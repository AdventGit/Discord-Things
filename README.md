# Things for my Discord

## Plugins

Updated plugins that I use or have made.
<!---Some of these plugins I've modified to better integrate into my theme.--->


## Themes

Instead of using a normal theme I'm using a Plugin so I can utilize a settings page (tV2.plugin.js). This allows me to add a "GUI" on the BD Plugins Settings page which will affect the theme. You can change color, transparency, guild sizes, badge sizes, and adding a background image (With or without still using transparency on Discord overall. What I mean is you can have an image and have Discord fully transparent. Cool right).
