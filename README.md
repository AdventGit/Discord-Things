# Things for my Discord

## Plugins

Some of these plugins I've modified to better integrate into my theme.


## Themes

In order to use my theme to the fullest you'll need to patch Discord to allow full transparency and patch the BetterDiscord `main.css` and `main.min.css` to remove all "!important" tags. You can either do so from my provided `desktop_core` folder or manually do so yourself if you know how. For transparency you can use the plugin `TransparencyPatcher.plugin.js`.

### The only theme file you need is `Advent.theme.css`.
